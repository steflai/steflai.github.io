            <h1>Code as a Gift</h1>
            <h2>A living, responsive web entity</h2>
            <p>I want to create a website than makes people feel heard / seen / cared for in some way.
              The internet, and technology more broadly, can feel like a somewhat unsympathetic black hole --
              users give their data, attention and money for services which are often not provided with care.
            </p>
            <p>I find it difficult to convey care with machine learning alone -- by nature ML algorithms take in any text, image or object just as raw materials with no context or (human) comprehension.
              What it does with the input feels alien and can be fantastic but not warm.
            </p>
            <p>So I've decided on a combination of twitter bot and website that will take tweets and either respond or use the tweet to 'grow' a tree.
              The twitter account will ask people to either share something positive - which will case the fractal tree to grow on a website;
              or they can ask the bot to say something nice to them if they're feeling a bit blue.
            </p>
            <p>To help something to grow feels rewarding. Hopefully this also applies to a virtual tree on the internet. I chose a fractal tree because it's generated by code but through our human eyes it turns into a tree.
              I'll attempt to compose with care an algorithm that can craft generated responses that feel warm, even as I plan to make it known that it's a machine tweeting back.
              Perhaps something that can break down parts of speech and use relevant word(s) in its response.
              The tree will grow with each tweet that's sent to it. Eventually it may grow too big, at which point new tweets will cause it to glow or change colour.
            </p>
            <p>Below is a tree made in p5 for illustration. You can click your mouse anywhere on this page to make it grow more branches, and press any key to make it grow leaves.

      <h1>Technical notes / musings</h1>
    <p style="font-family:monospace;">
      Use Python and tweepy to gather tweets from account <br>
      Tweets analyzed and stored in either text files or csv -- Python to write to file for storage<br>
      Final analysis method tbd, but can analyze by parts of speech and sentiment <br>
      Generation needs to be experimented with - textgenrnn? markovify? mad libs? <br>
      Need a sample dataset to start with <br>
      Python to detect if tweet says "tell me something nice", in which case use tweepy to reply with generated tweet <br>
      Script to be stored on vm to run x times daily <br>
      <br>
      Webpage on load to check number of tweets received by account <br>
      I hope this can be done by Javascript - either to check lenght of a csv or for Python script to make a counter file for it which just holds a number that is updated <br>
      The number will determine how many iterations of generation the tree goes through ie how big the tree is <br>
      Tree is made in p5 <br>
      Experiment with background, sound(?), simple animations
